# Projects Using C++ Language
It's all about C++ language.

### Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA): 
DSA is about finding efficient ways to store and retrieve data, to perform operations on data, and to solve specific problems. By understanding DSA, we can decide which data structure or algorithm is best for a given situation. Make programs that run faster or use less memory. <br>

### SOLID Design Priciples: 
Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) <br>
Open-Closed Principle (OCP)<br>
Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) <br>
Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) <br>
Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) <br>

### Memory Management, Multithreading, and CPU Utilization: 

CPU-intensive tasks are typically fast and require high-speed processing capabilities. Tasks that use memory, on the other hand, require large amounts of storage space to store data and program instructions. These tasks include storing and retrieving data, loading and unloading applications, and caching data. <br>
